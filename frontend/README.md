# Cosmic Carrots - An Idle Game Adventure

Cosmic Carrots is a casual idle game project that I developed as a personal challenge to explore new technologies and improve my development skills. The goal of the project was to take an idea generated by ChatGPT and rapidly turn it into a functional game.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js:** a framework for building fast and scalable React applications with server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind:** a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **TypeScript:** a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language.

I chose this technology stack for its ability to quickly build and deploy modern web applications, making it ideal for a project like this where speed and ease of development are important.

## Initial Idea by ChatGPT

The gameplay for Cosmic Carrots was initially brainstormed with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT model. ChatGPT helped me come up with ideas for managing resources, upgrading your planet, and exploring the universe. From there, I took these ideas and developed them into a fully-functional game.

## Using ChatGPT in Development

I decided to try using ChatGPT in the development of Cosmic Carrots for several reasons. Firstly, because of the hype around it. Secondly, I was curious about the potential of AI language models for software development and wanted to explore its capabilities for myself. Lastly, I wanted to challenge myself to think outside the box and try new approaches to problem-solving and ideation.

Moreover, I was excited about the prospect of having access to a vast database of information and suggestions at my fingertips, and the potential for rapid ideation and problem-solving that ChatGPT offered. I was intrigued by the idea of being able to quickly bounce ideas off an AI and see where it would take me.

ChatGPT proved to be an invaluable tool in the development of Cosmic Carrots. It helped me quickly generate ideas and brainstorm solutions to challenges I faced during development. Additionally, it provided suggestions for technology to use and allowed me to explore different approaches to development. However, as with any AI language model, there were limitations and it was important to carefully consider and validate the suggestions given by ChatGPT.

## Benefits and Limitations of Using ChatGPT

There are several benefits to using ChatGPT in the development process. First and foremost, it provides quick and easy access to a large database of information and suggestions, saving valuable time and effort in the development process. Additionally, it allows for rapid ideation and problem-solving, helping to overcome roadblocks and speed up development.

However, there are also limitations to using ChatGPT. Since it is an AI language model, the suggestions it provides may not always be accurate or relevant. Additionally, it's important to thoroughly vet the information provided by ChatGPT to ensure it meets the needs and requirements of the project.

Overall, I found that using ChatGPT was a valuable experience in the development of Cosmic Carrots, and I plan to continue utilizing this technology in future projects.
